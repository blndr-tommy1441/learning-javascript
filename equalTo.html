      <p>= is used for assigning values to a variable, == is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores the datatype of variable whereas === is used for comparing two variables, but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.</p>
      <p>= is called as assignment operator, == and === are called comparison operator.</p>
      <p>= does not return true or false, == Return true only if the two operands are equal while === returns true only if both values and data types are the same for the two variables.</p>
